# Client config breakout

## What is handlebars?

[Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) is a simple templating language.  
Here I use [handlebars-rust](https://github.com/sunng87/handlebars-rust) implementation. I use handlebars to have a way to flexible render data structures into string templates.

Example of rich template:
```
{{#if v}}󰖂 {{#each v}}{{this}}{{#unless @last}}, {{/unless}}{{/each}}{{else}}No VPNs{{/if}}
```

You can use handlebars [playground](https://handlebarsjs.com/playground.html) to play with templates.

## Segments

Segment is a building block of client config. Config may have many segments. Example config has two segments. Each segment has `name` field. When you ask client to render something you should pass segment's name as CLI parameter `--segment-name`.  
Each also segment have `direction` field affects how colors applied from `{fg,bg}_palette` and how `separator` works.  
And the most complex part of segment is parts list.

## Parts

Part mostly contains from `type` and `template` fields. Where type is a value from enumeration presented next and template is handlebars template string. Data structure passed to template stored in variable named `v`. Somewhere it is single value, in other parts it may be structure.
`_grpah` variables in `v` is a string with a special characters which represents simple line graph analog. f.e. `▁▃▅▇▇▇█`  

Available part types:
 - [session_name](#session-name)
 - [vpn](#vpn)
 - [mem](#memory)
 - [swap](#swap)
 - [cpu](#cpu)
 - [disk](#disk)
 - [load_average](#load-average)
 - [shell](#shell)
 
### Session name

Simple value with tmux session name in which status renders.

Data payload for template:
```rust
let v: String;
```

Example:
```yaml
type: session_name
template: ": {{v}}"
```

Renders to: `: MAIN`
 
### VPN

Data payload for template:
```rust
let v: Vec<String>;
```

Example:
```yaml
type: vpn
template: "{{#if v}}󰖂: {{#each v}}{{this}}{{#unless @last}}, {{/unless}}{{/each}}{{else}}No VPNs connected.{{/if}}"
names:
    - substring_matcher: "10.154.1."
      name: "prod"
    - substring_matcher: "10.154.154."
      name: "dev"
```

Renders to:
 - When you have a connected network with IP address containing "10.154.1."  
   `󰖂: prod`
 - When you have a connected networks with IP address containing "10.154.1." and "10.154.154"   
   `󰖂: prod, dev`
 - When none of above found  
   `No VPNs connected.`
 
### Memory

Data payload for template:
```rust
pub struct Memory {
    pub total: String,
    pub available: String,
    pub used: String,
    pub used_percents: String,
    pub used_percents_graph: String,
};

let v: Memory;
```

Example:
```yaml
type: mem
template: ": {{v.total}}/{{v.available}}/{{v.used}}"
```
Renders to: `: 32GB/22.84GB/8.33GB`

```yaml
type: mem
template:  {{v.used_percents}}% {{v.used_percents_graph}}
```
Renders to: `: 27% ▃▃▃▃▃▃▃`
 
### Swap

Data payload for template:
```rust
pub struct Swap {
    pub total: String,
    pub used: String,
    pub used_percents: String,
    pub used_percents_graph: String,
}

let v: Swap;
```

Example:
```yaml
type: swap
template: "Swap: {{v.total}}/{{v.used}}"
```
Renders to: `Swap: 8GB/1.22GB`
 

```yaml
type: swap
template: "󰾴: {{v.used_percents}}% {{v.used_percents_graph}}"
```
Renders to: `󰾴: 13% ▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁`
 
 
### CPU

Data payload for template:
```rust
pub struct CPU {
    pub consumption: String,
    pub consumption_graph: String,
}

let v: CPU;
```

Example:
```yaml
type: cpu
template: ": {{v.consumption}}%"
```

Renders to: `: 22%`

```yaml
type: cpu
template: ": {{v.consumption}}% {{v.consumption_graph}}"
```

Renders to: `: 99%  ▁▃▅▅▇▇▇█`
 

### Disk

Data payload for template:
```rust
pub struct DiskV {
    pub mount_point: String,
    pub device_path: String,
    pub available_space: String,
    pub total_space: String,
    pub used_percents: String,
}

let v: Disk;
```

Example:
```yaml
type: disk
dev: /dev/mapper/luks-7a504a5c-****-****-****-3a97c15a21ce
template: "  {{v.mount_point}} {{v.available_space}}"
```

Renders to: `  / 623.26GB`
 
### Load average

Data payload for template:
```rust
pub struct LA {
    pub one: String,
    pub five: String,
    pub fifteen: String,
}

let v: LA;
```

Example:
```yaml
type: load_average
template: "LA: {{v.one}}, {{v.five}}, {{v.fifteen}}"
```

Renders to: `LA: 1.01, 1.00, 0.93`
 
### Shell

Data payload for template:
```rust
pub struct Shell {
    pub stdout: String,
}

let v: Shell;
```

Example:
```yaml
type: shell
cmd: free -m -h | awk '/Mem/{printf $3"/"$2}'
template: "{{v.stdout}}"
```

Renders to: `8,5Gi/31Gi` (Result of command)
 

## Color palets

There are color palette in each segment. It may be empty or it may be list of HEX colors. If your parts list is longer than palette, clinet will use palette again and again.
If `direction` set to `ltr`, client will reverse palette. So basically you can use same palette in left and right segments, but two segments will consume palette from different sides.

## Separator

With separator you can replicate powerline theme. Just set symbol you want to see as separator and set correct direction for segment. Exapmple config has standart powerline separators ``
