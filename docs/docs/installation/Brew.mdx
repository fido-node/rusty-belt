## Install

Install from my personal tap.
You can validate it [here](https://github.com/fido-node/homebrew-barleywine/blob/main/Formula/rusty-belt.rb).

```
brew install fido-node/homebrew-barleywine/rusty-belt

Follow caveats from brew. 
It will guide you how to setup default config.
After that you can use `brew services` to run rusty_belt_server
